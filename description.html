<p>In the dynamic environment of telecommunications services, planning new services and changing existing ones is permanent and absorbs more and more forces and resources. The number of factors influencing resource allocation choices is constantly increasing and covers not only technical or economic but also environmental domains. Maintaining the cost/service requirement ratio at the assumed level is increasingly difficult and requires support for experts, preferably through deep automation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The implementation of services as 5G technology, and especially slicing, encounters a number of barriers resulting from the existing ways of CSPs' work. The main effort in creating and maintaining services is based on planning new services, while optimization is underestimated as a continuous process improving the efficiency of solutions – especially the cost-of-service implementation to maintain the planned parameters of the service. Performing this process through human work based on static rules in a dynamic environment is qualitatively and cost-inefficient. In order to activate the capabilities of modern systems, the following barriers should be eliminated:<p><br></p>
<p>The fundamental issue is to optimize the use of resources that we have to build the slice and other services through the perfect allocation of services on resources. In this way, we open the way to create further installations on saved resources.</p>

Performing this process through human work based on static rules in a dynamic environment is qualitatively and cost-inefficient. In order to activate the capabilities of modern systems, the following barriers should be eliminated:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Work in individual domains is performed by specialized experts - each of them has a fragmentary, silo view of the network and priorities (policies)</li><li>&nbsp;Solutions are typical, but individual – planning requires more time, and Time-To-Market increases, it is difficult to apply the same priorities and recommendations</li>
<li>&nbsp;Lack of continuous optimization results in planning with the use of excess funds just in case - inefficient use of resources for the planned Quality of Service</li>
<li>&nbsp;The changing topology of resources as a result of adding new ones is not used effectively – changes are occasionally made to existing services that increase security and reliability due to a large amount of work of experts needed</li>
<li>&nbsp;The work of experts without support makes it possible to take into account only a few priorities and recommendations, and their changes are introduced with a delay due to the need to learn new policies and change the habits of experts.</li>
